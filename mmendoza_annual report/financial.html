                <div class="parrafo">
                <p>We derive our revenues from two sources:</p>
<p>(1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees;</p>
<p>and (2) related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2019. Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types, and the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services.</p>

            <h1>Revenue by Cloud Service Offering</h1>
            <p>The information below is provided on a supplemental basis to give additional insight into the revenue performance of our individual core service offerings. All of the cloud offerings that we offer to customers are grouped into four major cloud service offerings. Subscription and support revenues consisted of the following (in millions):</p>
            <img src="images/revenue-data.png" alt="revenue data" class="data-revenue">
            <div class="div-box green-column">
                <div class="box green-financial">
                <p>Subscription and support revenues from the Community Cloud, Quip and our Industry Offerings were not significant in fiscal 2019. Quip revenue is included with Salesforce Platform and Other in the table above.</p>
<p>Our Industry Offerings and Community Cloud revenue are included in either Sales Cloud, Service Cloud or Salesforce Platform and Other depending on the primary service offering purchased. Revenue from our acquisition of MuleSoft in May 2018 is included in Salesforce Platform and Other.</p>
<p>As required under U.S. GAAP, we recorded unearned revenue related to acquired contracts from MuleSoft at fair value on the date of acquisition. As a result, we did not recognize certain revenues related to these acquired contracts that MuleSoft would have otherwise recorded as an independent entity. Of the $2.9 billion subscription and support revenue for Salesforce Platform and Other for fiscal 2019, approximately $360 million was attributed to MuleSoft.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="box green-financial">
                <p>We do not update these allocations based on actual product usage during the term of the contract. We have allocated approximately 17 percent, 15 percent, 13 percent of our total subscription and support revenues for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017, respectively, based on customers’ estimated product demand plans and these allocated amounts are included in the table above.</p>
<p>Additionally, some of our service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use the Sales Cloud, the Service Cloud or the Salesforce Platform to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these core service offerings.</p> 
<p>Depending on a customer’s actual and projected business requirements, more than one core service offering may satisfy the customer’s current and future needs</p>
